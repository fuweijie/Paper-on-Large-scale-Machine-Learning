We present a comprehensive overview of LML according to three computational perspectives:
1) model simplification, which reduces computational complexities by simplifying predictive models; 
2) optimization approximation, which enhances computational efficiency by designing better optimization algorithms; 
3) computation parallelism, which improves computational capabilities by scheduling multiple computing devices.
## Model Simplification.
## Optimization Approximation.
## Computation Parallelism.
## Hybrid Collaboration.
